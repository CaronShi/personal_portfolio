                            <p>
                                I have independently developed a responsive web application that bears similarities to
                                Yelp's functionality. This platform serves as a business search with
                                autocomplete, enabling users to seamlessly explore results. Users could effortlessly
                                access essential business details, fostering informed decision-making.
                                To provide unparalleled convenience, I incorporated the capability to visualize
                                business locations on Google Maps. I also devised an efficient
                                reservation feature, granting users the convenience of securing their spots.
                                By seamlessly integrating this functionality, I enrich the user experience, ultimately
                                contributing to the platform's appeal and usability.

                                <br>
                                <br>In the creation of this comprehensive web application, I harnessed a diverse array
                                of cutting-edge technologies to ensure a seamless user experience and robust
                                functionality, including <b>
                                    <strong> Angular, Node.js, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Javascript,
                                        Bootstrap, Restful API, and delopyed on Google GCP.

                                    </strong>
                                </b>

                            </p>

                            <br>

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </section>


                <h3 class="h2 article-title">Pages' Detail & Functions</h3>
                <h3>1. Business Search</h3>
                <p>Business search form is for collecting basic information for searching a business, including
                    keywords, distance, category and location fields with form validation. Also, there are "Submit" and
                    "Clear" button for users to either submit or clear the form.</p>

                <p>
                    <strong><b>Keywords Input with Autocomplete</b></strong><br>
                    The "Keywords" input field, enhanced with an autocomplete feature, empowers users to efficiently
                    input relevant terms or phrases for their search. The autocomplete functionality predicts and
                    suggests possible keywords as users type, saving time and reducing errors. This dynamic interaction
                    refines the search experience, assisting users in finding accurate results effortlessly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong><b>Location Input with Auto-detection</b></strong><br>
                    The "Location" input field not only allows users to manually input their desired location but also
                    features an autodetection option. By clicking "Auto-detect my location" checkbox, the form leverages
                    the <strong><b>ip.info API</b></strong> to
                    detect the user's IP address and approximate geographical location. This seamless integration saves
                    users from manually entering their location, providing real-time convenience. With this function,
                    users can effortlessly receive results tailored to their current whereabouts, all while enjoying the
                    benefits of autocomplete and other functionalities.

                <h3>2. Search Results</h3>
                <p>After users submit the form, they will be presented with a comprehensive list comprising the top 10
                    relevant business results, meticulously sorted based on their proximity in a non-decreasing order.
                    This well-structured <strong><b>table</b></strong> encompasses four essential columns, each
                    delivering crucial insights. The
                    first column showcases the index, providing a sequential reference for each entry. The second column
                    elegantly displays the business logo or image, adding a visual element to the presentation. Moving
                    forward, the business name is elegantly featured in the third column, granting users quick
                    identification of the establishments. In the fourth column, users are promptly informed of the
                    business's rating, offering valuable feedback on its quality. The fifth and final column of the
                    table displays the distance to the business location, expressed in miles, procured from
                    the <strong><b>Yelp RESTful
                            API.</b></strong>
                </p>

                <h3>3. Business Details</h3>
                <p>Upon clicking a business result in the displayed table, users will access comprehensive
                    details of this business showing in a <strong><b>Modal</b></strong> component. There are three
                    subpages, business details, map, and reviews.
                    The first page encompasses
                    essential aspects such as the business's name,
                    operational status, social media links, contact information, and three
                    photos with fixed size using <strong><b>Carousel</b></strong> plugin. Also, an interative
                    <strong><b>inserted Google Map</b></strong> is available in second subpage.

                <h3>4. Revervation Form</h3>
                <p>
                    Users could submit reservations directly from this web to businesses while benefiting
                    <strong><b>from validation</b></strong>
                    for accurate input. The form will feature an integrated date picker and time picker,
                    enhancing user convenience. After successfully submit, an alert window will be pop-up for
                    confirmation, then the "Cancel Reservation" button will show instead of "Reserve Now" button.
