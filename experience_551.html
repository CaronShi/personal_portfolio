                <h2>Backgroud</h2>
                <p><strong><b>Motivation</b></strong><br>
                    Higher education provides numerous benefits to individuals as well as to society. It
                    is not only
                    associated with higher income levels and better employment opportunities, but also
                    plays a key
                    role in the nation’s economic growth and social prosperity. With great opportunities
                    come great
                    challenges as prospective students start their journey to find the perfect school.
                    On the path to securing college admission, students consider various aspects such
                    as: fields of
                    study, college ranking, study costs, location and cost of living. In this project,
                    we aim to help
                    students by developing a tool that collects, analyzes and visualizes critical
                    college related data.
                    This application will allow students to gauge how quantitative factors (SAT, GRE and
                    GPA) is
                    perceived by different colleges and help them make informed decisions to improve
                    their
                    admission chances.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong><b>Goal</b></strong><br>

                    Develop a web-based data application to assist prospective students in finding the
                    right school
                    by examining college admission and location data in the United States.

                <h2>Application Component</h2>
                <p><strong><b>Firestore Cloud Database</b></strong><br>
                    Our first dataset is of colleges admissions data. the data was exported from IPEDS,
                    the Integrated
                    Postsecondary Education Data System. A cloud database has been setup on Firestore to
                    maintain
                    and manage application data (colleges dataset).
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong><b>Numbeo API</b></strong><br>

                    Our second data source is Numbeo, a crowd-sourced global database of quality-of-life
                    information. It is used to support our college admission data and provide general
                    city
                    information, such as, housing indicators, perceived crime rates, and quality of
                    healthcare, among
                    others. The data is fetched on demand utilizing Numbeo API through an academic
                    license.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong><b>Flask Web Service</b></strong><br>
                    A web service was created to connect the frontend with the data sources. It is aimed
                    to fetch the
                    data from both data sources and export it to the frontend ready to be displayed and
                    visualized.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong><b>Machine Learning Model</b></strong><br>
                    A web service was created to connect the frontend with the data sources. It is aimed
                    to fetch the
                    data from both data sources and export it to the frontend ready to be displayed and
                    visualized.
                    A Machine Learning model was developed to provide college recommendations based on a
                    student’s academic standing. The model was developed using Scikit-learn package to
                    conduct
                    unsupervised learning and cluster out colleges by their standard exam scores (SAT
                    and ACT) and
                    their acceptance rate.
                    The model input includes standardized test scores (SAT and ACT), and the acceptance
                    (a
                    calculated value from dividing total admissions over total applicants), the lower
                    the rate the more
                    competitive a college’s admission. For example, if the acceptance rate of USC is
                    10%, it assumes
                    students who are top 10% or exceed 90% of all applicants in academic performance and
                    other
                    backgrounds could get offers from USC. The measure of academic performance and
                    backgrounds
                    for undergraduate students is usually based on their GPA, AP, research or leadership
                    experience,
                    academic awards, and scholarships. Therefore, by calculating a student’s acceptance
                    rate using
                    the five factors, we could get an acceptance rate number which matches a ML cluster
                    combined
                    with his SAT or ACT score.
                    In order to build a ML model, first, by preprocessing the raw data, we standardized
                    all inputs,
                    such as replacing the blank values. Second, we normalized the data into range 0 to 1
                    by min-max
                    scaler for better clustering. Also, we used K-means clustering and
                    decided the cluster
                    number 7 by the elbow method. Finally, we built a ML model and saved the
                    model
                    locally for a faster operation.

                <h2>
                    Reflection On Learning
                </h2>
                <p>
                    • Collaboration:
                    <br>Throughout this semester, our group has developed some excellent team-working
                    skills. Individuals specialize in areas and contribute to the team through the work
                    we produce. By collaborating, we become more confident in our knowledge and
                    our abilities to carry project activities effectively.<br>
                    • Effective communication:
                    <br>Maintaining effective communication helped us keep our project on the right
                    track. Especially during the pandemic, we took advantage of virtual meetings to
                    scheduled weekly discussion to sharing ideas, updating project progress and plan
                    future activities. Additionally, we have a message group chat for quick and easy
                    communication and a shared drive for file sharing. Those strategies help our group
                    to exceed the project deadline.<br>
                    • Cloud database storage and access:
                    <br>With this project, our team members are required to use different types of data
                    sources with cloud storage. From this project, we learned technical skills in cloud
                    database storage using Firebase and manage access data through web application
                    building with Streamlit. We believe those skills empower us to and have a good
                    impact on our future careers’ opportunities.
                </p>
                <h2>Challenges Faced

                </h2>
                <p>

                    • Finding complete and accessible data about colleges and cities’ quality of life.
                    Various sources that offer such data but none of them were up to date or
                    comprehensive enough to cover our project scope, until we found IPEDS and
                    Numbeo’s. IPEDS is open source, so we were able to identify and customize the
                    list of properties we need. Numbeo, however, required an API license. We their
                    support team to request a free-of-charge academic license for the duration of our
                    project, and our request was granted.<br>
                    • Integrating college data and city data in a meaningful manner.
                    Naturally, different sources have different formats and standards, so we were
                    challenged by merging the two datasets together while ensuring data consistency
                    and completeness.<br>
                    • Learning different new technologies and frameworks.
                    A learning curve was expected as we work on the implementation of our project.
                    We are exposed to different technologies for different phases of a development
                    cycle, and it has been an enjoyable challenge so far.
